## Introduction and Goals

In our Project we coded a hat game called "Boar Hat". It has a GUI and it is made by using Windows Forms.

**My goals in this project are:**
- To explain what Windows Forms is.
- What the items are which we used in our project.

## What is Windows Forms?
WinForms is a Library from C-Sharp. You can create GUIs just by drag and drop. You have a very wide range of objects you can use.

You can see a demonstration in the Video below. 

<br>

But this is only the look, not the functionality. WinForms does not work like "normal" code, it is a event based code.
This means you have a method like this:

```csharp
private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    //Here is your code which gets executed.
}
```

The code in the Function gets only executed when you click the specific button. In this case "button1".

To edit the Objects you can use the "Properties" Tab to set the standard values and you can set the values in the code.

## Our used Objects

**Button:** <br>
You can use a button to execute some code when you click on it. This can also combined with some requirements like a login page.

**Label:** <br>
A label is used to bring text into your form. You have many customization options for it like the font.

**Text Box:** <br>
You can use the textbox to bring values or information into your program like your username or password on a login page.

## Verification and Reflection

Goal 1: I explained WinForms in the first section.

Goal 2: I listet a few objects in the second section.

When I started with coding I was always fascinated to code my own applications with GUIs. When we got introduced with WinForms I liked it because you can add the missing design. It gives you the opportunity to make your programme stand out from the rest.

In my view it's more difficult to do programs in WinForms than in console-apps even if you don't have to code the gui for yourself. I want to use GUIs for the most of my CSharp projects in the future.
